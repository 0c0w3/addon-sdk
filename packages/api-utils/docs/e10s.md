The `e10s` module allows add-ons to execute in a separate process from Firefox itself.

<api name="ChromeProcess">
@class
  In an add-on process, this represents the parent chrome process. This class is a singleton and has no constructor. It is automatically injected into the global scope of all `-e10s-adapter` modules as the `chrome` object.

<api name="on">
@method
  Registers an event listener with the chrome process.
@param type {string}
  The type of event to listen for.
@param listener {function}
  The listener function that handles the event. Its first argument is always `type`, and additional arguments vary depending on the event's originating `addon.send()` call in the chrome process.
</api>

<api name="removeListener">
@method
  Removes an event listener from the chrome process.
@param type {string}
  The type of event for which `listener` was registered.
@param listener {function}
  The listener function that was registered.
</api>

<api name="send">
@method
  Sends an event asynchronously to the chrome process. Any additional arguments after `type` are passed as arguments to event listeners in the chrome process.
@param type {string}
  The type of event to send.
</api>

<api name="call">
@method
  Synchronously calls a remote function in the chrome process and returns its result. Any additional arguments after `name` are passed as arguments to the function in the chrome process.
@param name {string}
  The name of the function to call.
</api>

<api name="createHandle">
@method
  Creates a [handle][] object, which can be passed to the chrome process via `send()` or `call()`.
